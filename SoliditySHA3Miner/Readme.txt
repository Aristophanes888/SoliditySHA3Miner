Current latest public release version: 1.3.0.0

Built with .NET Core 2.1 SDK, VC++ 2017, gcc 4.8.5,, nVidia CUDA SDK 9.2 64-bits, and AMD APP SDK v3.0.130.135 (OpenCL)
.NET 4.7.1 can be downloaded from https://microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56116
VC++ 2017 can be downloaded from https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads
CUDA 9.2 requires a minimum nVidia driver version of 396.xx [https://www.nvidia.com/drivers/beta]

NOTES
Do refer to 'GuideForPoolMining.txt' and 'GuideForSoloMining.txt' on how to get started.
Configuration is based on CLI (similar to ccminer), except ".abi" files are required for new tokens (You can manually create one and copy from etherscan.com -> Contract -> Code -> Contract ABI).
A sample CLI launch parameter can be found in the ".bat" file found together with this miner, please refer to it if you need help.
You will have to supply your own Ethereum address (or Private key if you solo mine). It is your own responsibility to mine to the correct address/account.
It is recommended to use your own web3api (e.g. Geth / Parity) if you solo mine.
There is a default of 2.0% dev fee (Once every 50th nounces: starting from 1st if Pool mine, or starting from 50th if Solo mine).
You can set to the lowest 1.5% with "devFee=1.5" (the formula is "(nonce mod devFee) = 0").
Dev fee in solo mining is by sending the current reward amount after the successful minted block, using the same gas fee as provided in 'gasToMine'.
In the case if the compute load for your GPU is not >= 99%, you can adjust the intensity via (amdIntensity/cudaIntensity/intelIntensity).

Please feedback your results and suggestions so that I can improve the miner. You can either add an issue in the repository, or find me in discord (Amano7). Thanks for trying out this miner!
